# liri

Liri is a node application that mimics functionality seen on bot-assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

#

Step one.

For this application to work, you must carefully install the list of requirements, which include:

1. Node-Spotify-API

2. Request

3. Moment

4. DotEnv

#

Step two.

In your .env file, follow the format of the keys.js file to replace the placeholders with your own spotify, bands in town, and OMDB API keys.

#

Step three.

Once you've properly installed everything, in your terminal or bash window type "node liri.js" then one of three commands:

1. concert-this --> grabs information for upcoming concerts of the artist you type in

2. spotify-this --> grabs information from the track you type in
3. movie-this --> grabs information on the movie name you typed in

Followed by the corresponding search item:

1. artist name for concert-this command
2. track name for spotify-this command
3. movie name for movie-this command

And voila! You've just scored yourself some concerts, songs, or movies of your choosing!
